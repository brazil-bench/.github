# Brazil Bench Organization

The purpose of this organization is to generate benchmark results that compare approaches to agent development management on the same task.

The standard task is to create an MCP server for a brazilian football statistics knowledge graph, and every benchmark starts with an empty repo that contains the spec, which is created from the benchmark-template repo provided here.

A secondary purpose is to explore and develop mechanisms that automate the development management of agents in a purposeful way.

- The Pourpoise repo contains the workflows that automate the setup and evaluation of benchmark repos
- The Benchmark-Template repo contains the starting point spec that is cloned for each benchmark

All other repos are benchmarks where an agent did some work based on the spec.

Initially created by Claude-code, November 2025 with guidance from Adrian Cockcroft
